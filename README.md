# Instruments
Instruments is an attempt to replace the [Evora telescope server](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) system focused on simplicity and maintainability.


## Development
To set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) on your system.
3. Run `conda create --name uwmro_instruments python` to create a new environment
5. Run `conda activate uwmro_instruments` to run the environment 


## Running
Follow the instructions above, then:

1. Make sure the virtual environment is active
2. `python3 main.py`


## Installation
Eventually this will be handled by `pip install mro_instruments` or something similar.
