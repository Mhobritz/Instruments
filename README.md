# Instruments
Instruments is an attempt to replace the [Evora telescope server](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) system focused on simplicity and maintainability.


## Development
To set up the development environment:

1. Clone this repo
2. [Install Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to manage dependencies
3. Run `poetry install` in the project directory to create a virtual environment with required dependencies
4. Run `poetry shell` to activate the virtual environment


## Running
Follow the instructions above, then:

1. Make sure the virtual environment is active
2. `python3 main.py`


## Installation
Eventually this will be handled by `pip install mro_instruments` or something similar.
